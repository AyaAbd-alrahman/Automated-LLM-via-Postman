⭐ Project Description — LLM QA Automation using Postman & Gemini API

This project demonstrates a fully automated workflow for testing, evaluating, and validating Large Language Model (LLM) responses using Postman, Google Gemini API, and Postman Monitors. The goal is to ensure that LLM-generated content is correct, consistent, and aligned with predefined expectations through automated test cases and evaluator models.

🚀 Overview

The system automates the process of:

Sending prompts to the Google Gemini LLM model.

Collecting the model’s responses.

Evaluating the correctness of each response using a second LLM (Evaluator Model).

Running test collections automatically through Postman Monitors.

Reporting results with pass/fail outcomes in real time.

This approach removes manual evaluation effort and transforms LLM quality assurance into a structured, repeatable, and scalable process.

🔧 Key Components
🧪 1. LLM Query Endpoints

Each test case sends a prompt to the Gemini model using the generateContent endpoint.
Examples include:

General knowledge questions

Story generation

Math reasoning

Domain-specific tasks
The model response is extracted and stored dynamically for later evaluation.

🧩 2. LLM-Based Evaluators

Instead of using fixed scripts or hard-coded logic, the evaluation is done by a second LLM, which:

Receives the original prompt

Receives the model’s response

Compares them

Outputs only “Correct” or “Incorrect”

This makes the evaluation more flexible and closer to human reasoning.

🔁 3. Postman Test Scripts

JavaScript test scripts run automatically to:

Parse Gemini responses

Extract model output

Inject it into evaluator requests

Assert evaluator decisions

Mark tests as passed/failed

📡 4. Environment Variables

Postman environments store:

API key

Base URL

Model name

Extracted model_response
This ensures clean and reusable test collections.

📊 5. Monitoring & Automation

A Postman Monitor executes the entire collection on a schedule (hourly, daily, etc.) and:

Executes all test cases

Runs evaluator validations

Generates a pass/fail summary

Sends alerts when something breaks
This provides continuous QA for LLM behavior.

🧠 Project Workflow

User prompt → Gemini model

Gemini generates model response

Response saved as environment variable (model_response)

Evaluator request sent with:

Original prompt

Expected logic

model_response

Evaluator returns “Correct” or “Incorrect”

Postman test marks test case as PASS or FAIL

Monitor runs everything automatically and logs results
